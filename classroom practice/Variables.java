/**
 * Different types of variables in Java:
 * 1. Local variables - declared inside a method
 * 2. Instance variables - defined inside a class and outside a method
 * 3. Static variables - declared with the static keyword
    * The static vairable gets memory only once in the class area at the time of class loading.
    * The static variable belongs to the class rather than the object.
    * A static variable can be accessed directly by the class name and doesn't need any object.
    * It can be used for variable, method, block and nested class.
